## Deployed Application
[Class Portfolio](https://darrindevs.github.io/class-portfolio/)

## Summary 
This project is a portfolio of work from my Coding Bootcamp course. 

It was created from scratch and uses advanced CSS skills such as flexbox, media queries and CSS variables. Take a look at it on different screeen sizes to see how the application transforms. 

The site is optimized for search engines through the application of accessibility standards using semantic HTML elements, accessible alt attributes, sequential heading attributes and a concise, descriptive title.

The stylesheet has been thoroughly commented to provide the reader with a clear organization of the semantic elements and overview of refactored code.
